# Metadata for Information on CSO Remediation Projects
Write ups were originally from an e-mail from Charlene Poulin to Curtis C. 
Bohlen from February 6th 2020. The excel data and the revised version of the 
Westbrook write-up are from an e-mail from Dennis Welch to Curtis C. Bohlen on 
October 8th, 2020.

The Excel file is simple, containing annual discharge volumes for two
CSOs located in Westbrook. Volumes are annual discharge totals, in gallons.
