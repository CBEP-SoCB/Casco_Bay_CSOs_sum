```

# Load Weather Data
## Access data
We extract annual Precipitation Totals (in mm), and Annual Days with more than
one tenth of an inch (2.5mm), and one inch (25.4mm) of rain from the annual
weather summaries from NOAA.
```{r rain_data}
fn <-'Annual_Weather_PWD.csv'
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)
rain_data <- read_csv(fpath, col_types =
                       cols(date = col_datetime(format = ""),
                            datatype = col_character(),
                            value = col_double(),
                            attributes = col_character(),
                            station = col_skip())) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(format(date, format = '%Y'))) %>%
  filter (datatype %in% c('PRCP', 'DP10', 'DP1X')) %>%
  select(Year, datatype, value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = datatype, values_from = value) %>%
  rename(Precip_mm = PRCP, GT0.1 = DP10, GT1.0 = DP1X) %>%
  mutate(Precip_in = Precip_mm / 25.4) %>%
  filter(Year > 1996)
```

## Examine Correlations
```{r precip_correlations}
cor(rain_data, use = 'pairwise')
```
There are what are likely to be statistically significant correlations between
year and number of large storm and total rainfall even over this short period.
(See the Climate Change indicator for analysis of a longer time series.)

The high correlation between number of large storms and total precipitation may
complicate separating those two factors in any analysis.

# Refine Data
## Casco Bay Towns Data
Although the number of events and outfalls were reported in the 2008 CSO report
for years prior to 2006, they show no variation, suggesting these data are not
meaningful, so we strip them out here.
```{r casco_towns_data}
cb_towns_data_long <- the_data %>%
  mutate(VolumeMG = Volume / (10^6)) %>%
  filter(Year > 1996)

cb_towns_data_wide <- cb_towns_data_long %>%
  pivot_wider(Year, names_from = Community,
              values_from = c(Volume, Events, Outfalls),
              names_repair = 'universal') %>%
  rename_with(~ sub('\\.\\.\\.', '.', .x )) %>% # replace triple dots in Portland
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(c(Volume_Cape.Elizabeth,
                       Volume_Portland.PWD,
                       Volume_South.Portland,
                       Volume_Westbrook,
                       Volume_Yarmouth), na.rm = TRUE),
         PctPortland = Volume_Portland.PWD/Total) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Totals Data
Including total discharge volumes each year, in Millions of Gallons.
```{r annual_data}
annual_data <- the_data %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(CBTotVol      = sum(Volume, na.rm = TRUE),
            CBVolMG    = CBTotVol / (10^6),
            CBTotEvents   = sum(Events, na.rm = TRUE),
            CBTotOutfalls = sum(Outfalls, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  filter(Year > 1996)
```

# Correlations by Year
## Merge Three Data Sets
```{r assemble_data}
annual_data_all <- rain_data %>%
  left_join(cb_towns_data_wide, by = 'Year') %>%
  select (-Total) %>%
  rename(PctCascoPortland = PctPortland) %>%
  left_join(annual_data, by = 'Year') %>%
  mutate(CSO_MG_per_inch = CBVolMG / Precip_in)
rm(annual_data, cb_towns_data_wide, rain_data, the_data)
```

```{r correlation_figure}
cors <- cor(annual_data_all, use = 'pairwise')
corrplot(cors, method="circle", type = 'upper', tl.cex = .5)
rm(cors)
```
What jumps out is:

1. Year is negatively correlated with volume and events.  
2. Year is positively (though not strongly) correlated with precipitation.   
3. Total CSO VOlumes and Events statewide are dropping even faster than in
   our region, so the percentage of the states CSOs from her is climbing.  
4. Volume and number of CSO events are correlated across the region. Bad
   years in one jurisdiction are bad for many.  
5. Portland's CSOs are a big enough part of regional and state-wide totals
   so that they are always highly correlated with totals.  
6.  The precipitation variables are not all that highly
    correlated with the other variables

# Generate Models and Extract Coefficients
We want to extract slopes for the reduction in CSO volumes for each of our
communities.  Since Yarmouth is no longer considered a CSO
community, we exclude them from the analysis.

Here we use the tidyverse's nested tibbles (with list columns) to automate 
identical statistical analyses for each town.

Given the high variability of CSO discharge numbers, and the strongly non-normal
structure of errors, it is unlikely that standard linear regressions would be
suited to documenting the rate of reduction in CSO volumes.  Here we calculate
both linear regressions on log of discharges and Theil-Sen median-based 
regressions (actually, a modification by Seigel) untransformed data.

We use a log transformed analysis with the linear models as it better
addresses the structure of the data, and allows us to readily reinterpret
model coefficients in terms of an annual proportional reduction in volumes.

In our initial CSO draft, we reported  long term annual proportional reductions
in discharges, based on Theil-Sen slopes on log-transformed data, but one
reviewer objected to that presentation, in part because of lack of clarity on
our part of what the numbers presented represented.That sent us back to the
analysis, where we looked more closely at model diagnostics, and concluded that
the median-based models had not performed very well on log-transformed data. 

Statistical significance of a (bivariate) Theil-Sen slope estimate can be 
evaluated via the test for significance of the closely-related Kendall's Tau
correlation coefficient. We use `cor.test()` to test for significance.  We do
not extract the p value of the linear models, as we would not believe them
anyway, but we do look at the related t statistic, to help get a sense of the
strength of the evidence supporting a linear trend.  The two methods give
similar assessments of which slopes are robust, although slope estimates differ
somewhat.

         tslogslope = unlist(map(mylogts, function(m) coef(m)[2]))) %>%
        # Kendal's Tau and relate P value are identical for transformed and
        # untransformed values, since Kendal's Tau, which is based on order, not 
        # magnitude.

# Diagnostic Plots
## Log Least Squares Models
```{r diagnostics_least_squares}
oldpar = par(mfrow = c(2,2))
for (c in res$Community){
  plot(res[res$Community == c,]$mylm[[1]], main = c)
}
par(oldpar)
```

The residuals from the log-linear models are not bad.  There are a few outliers.  
We have no outliers with high leverage.  These models are actually not bad.
 
## Log Median Based Models
```{r diagnotics_log_TS}
oldpar = par(mfrow = c(2,2))
for (c in res$Community){
  plot(res[res$Community == c,]$mylogts[[1]], main = c)
}
par(oldpar)
```
Note that the standardized residuals are NOT normally distributed and indeed
appear biased away from zero.

## Untransformed Median Based Models
```{r diagnotics_TS}
oldpar = par(mfrow = c(2,2))
for (c in res$Community){
  plot(res[res$Community == c,]$myts[[1]], main = c)
}
par(oldpar)
```

## Least Squares Models Are The Best
Of the three, the model diagnostics, especially the distribution of residuals,
look better for the least squares models. 

It's not clear why the Theil-Sen estimators are consistently above the observed 
data.

## Commentary
None of those models perform well (looking on a linear scale) for all 
communities. The linear models (red) perform best, especially when viewed on a 
log scale, but they fail to reflect the very high early discharges.  While these
models are STATISTICALLY appropriate, they fail to communicate long-term trends
to readers in an appropriate way -- at least without adding graphics.

# Calculate Annual Percent Changes
The relationship between slope based on log-transformed variables and percent 
change is simply the following:

$$\frac{y(t+1)-y(t))}{y(t)}=e^m-1$$
So, we can summarize the model results as follows:
```{r annual_pct_change}
res %>%
  select(Community, lmslope, tslogslope) %>%
  mutate(across(c(lmslope, tslogslope), ~ (exp(.)-1) * 100)) %>%
  rename(Ann_Pct_Chng_lm = lmslope,
         Ann_Pct_Chng_ts = tslogslope)
```
These are statistically correct annual proportional reductions, but they
do not capture overall change al that well, as pointed out by one of our 
reviewers.

## Casco Bay - Wide Reductions over 23-Years
We repeat the analysis, based on the sum of all discharges by town.
```{r overall_log_analyses}
tmp  <- cb_towns_data_long %>%
  select(Year, Volume) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(Volume, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(logVolume = log(Total + 100))        # + 100 for consistency
                                              # but not really needed here
  
overalllm <-  lm(logVolume ~ Year, data = tmp)
lmslope   <-  coef(overalllm)[2]
lmsd      <-  coef(summary(overalllm))[, 2][[2]]
tlm       <-  lmslope/lmsd


overallts <- mblm(logVolume ~ Year, data = tmp)
tsslope   <- coef(overallts)[2]

tsCortest <- cor.test(tmp$Year, tmp$logVolume, method = 'kendall')
tscor     <-  tsCortest$estimate
tsp       <-  tsCortest$p.value

cat('Linear Model Slope = ', lmslope, '\n')
cat('t Statistic = ', tlm, '\n')
cat('Related estimate of Annual Percent Change =',
    (exp(lmslope)-1) * 100, '\n')
cat('Theil-Sen Slope = ', tsslope, '\n')
cat('Related p value = ', tsp, '\n')
cat('Related estimate of Annual Percent Change =',
    (exp(tsslope)-1) * 100, '\n')
```

## Calculate Long Term Reductions
Because the models do not really meet our needs, We calculate three year
mean and geometric mean discharges for the first three years and last three
years of our record.  Comparisons of those quanitites  better capture the 
type of long-term trend in CSO discharges that our reviewers wanted highlighted.
```{r build_df_for_long-term}
cb_totals <- cb_towns_data_long %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(Volume = sum(Volume, na.rm = TRUE),
            Outfalls = sum(Outfalls, na.rm = TRUE),
            VolumeMG = Volume / (10^6)) %>%
  mutate(Community = 'TOTAL')


tmp <- cb_towns_data_long %>%
  bind_rows(cb_totals) %>%
  mutate(selection = if_else (Year < 2000,
                              'Early',
                              if_else(Year > 2016, 'Recent',NA_character_))) %>%
    filter(! is.na(selection)) %>%
    mutate(Community = factor(Community, levels = c('Cape Elizabeth',
                                                    'Portland & PWD',
                                                    'South Portland',
                                                    'Westbrook',
                                                    'Yarmouth',
                                                    'TOTAL')))
```

```{r long-term_comparison_results}
tmp %>%
  replace_na(list(Volume = 0, Events = 0, VolumeMG = 0)) %>%
  group_by(Community, selection) %>%
  summarize(AvgVol    = mean(Volume),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(Community, names_from = 'selection', values_from = AvgVol) %>%
  mutate(PctChange = 100* round(((Recent - Early)/Early),3))
  
```
